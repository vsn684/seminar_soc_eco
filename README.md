## Summary
This study uses an agent-based model (ABM) to explore how labor market policies affect economic inequality, focusing on Denmark's flexicurity model and Japan's internal labor market.

## Key Insights
- **Unemployment Insurance:** Reduces inequality with minimal unemployment impact.
- **Active Labor Market Policies:** Lowers unemployment but may increase inequality.
- **Institutional Structures:** Less flexible markets show lower unemployment due to structural frictions.

## Future Work
- Extend agent behavior modeling.
- Incorporate firm dynamics and varied employment types.
- Use empirical data for calibration.

**Keywords:** Flexicurity, Labor Market, Inequality, ABM, Denmark, Japan
